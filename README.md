# Work Day Scheduler

## Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day.  It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Employees with busy schedules will be able to add important events or tasks to this daily planner so that s/he can manage their time effectively.


## Steps

1. The webpage loads with a live clock for today.
2. When the user clicks on the taskbar within a timeblock, s/he will be able to add important events or tasks to that hour.
3. The user will then click on the save button for that timeblock and the text for that event will be saved in local storage. 
4. The user will see that the timeblocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
5. When the page is refreshed, the saved events/tasks persist.
